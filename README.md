# CSCI-596-Final-Project
### Team member: Kai Chen, Jingxin Zhang

## 1. Visualization
We simulate Carbon Nanotube using Gromacs and jupyter.

Carbon Nanotube

We also visualize the DNA.

DNA


## 2. Prediction

Using Carbon Nanotubes Dataset in Kaggle.
This dataset contains 10721 initial and calculated atomic coordinates of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)

We would use neural network, Linear Regression and some other machine learning models to predict Calculated atomic coordinates(u',v',w'), and compare accuracy.


## 3. Performance Profile

Our team would use cProfile to analysis python program and uses nakeviz and viztracer to visualize the result.
